# CIFAR10_ImageClassification

In this project, a step by step process will be presented for the Image Classification task on CIFAR10 dataset. In this Image Classification problem, not only 
will I design and develop a simple and efficient model from scratch to classify the data but also learn how to implement a pre-trained model.
I will also compare the performance of the two models.

CIFAR10 dataset will be used which is comprised of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. It is considered as one of the best dataset 
to start working with. Actually, the small image resolution and the large number of images make it a great tool for quickly tuning a machine learning model. 

Image classification is the process of a model classifying input images into their respective category classes. In this project, the two following methods will be used:

<ul>
  <li>Training a small network from scratch </li>
  <li>Fine tuning the top layers of baseline models </li>
</ul>
